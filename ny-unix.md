# New in NAV

When you have just started as a developer or a data analyst/engineer in NAV there is a lot of software and access that needs to be set up!
This guide will try to take you through most of the important bits and pieces that you will need in everyday use.
Some parts are not necessary for every one and will be highlighted as such.

## Set up your NAV account

When you start in NAV you will get a NAV-ident and an e-mail (firstname.lastname@nav.no).
Before you can continue you need to reset the password set for that account.

1. Go to Microsoft Password Reset: [Password reset](https://aka.ms/sspr)
    - The default password is your NAV-ident with an `x` between the letter and numbers (W123456 = Wx123456)
2. Follow the steps

!!! info
    Another name for NAV account is AD account, which is short for Active Directory.

## Access to Slack

Before you can get a compliant device, you need access to Slack.

1. Go to [MyApps](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) and click on the `Slack - NAV IT`-app.
2. Go to [nav-it.slack.com](https://nav-it.slack.com).
3. Choose `Sign in with Azure` for log in.

!!! danger
    Be aware that there are several similar looking Slack workspaces that is not the official one!
    The correct one is [nav-it.slack.com](https://nav-it.slack.com).

## Compliant device

The first thing you need to do is to make you device compliant and this is done with [Naisdevice](../operate/naisdevice).

1. Start by following this guide for setting up Kolide: [Install Kolide](../operate/naisdevice/how-to/install-kolide)
2. After that you need to install the tool [Naisdevice]: [Install Naisdevice](../operate/naisdevice/how-to/install-kolide)

## Access to Github

Before you can start helping your team with coding you need to get access to the [navikt](https://github.com/navikt) organization on Github.
You can either use your private Github account, or create a new account specific NAV.

1. Enable two-factor authentication for your account: [Settings/Password and authentication](https://github.com/settings/security)
    - Settings > Password and authentication
    - There are no restriction for which authenticator app you use.
1. Add your NAV specific e-mail-address to your account: [Settings/Emails](https://github.com/settings/emails)
    - Settings > Emails > Add email address
2. Visit [MyApps](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) and click on the `github.com/navikt`-app.
